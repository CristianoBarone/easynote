# Easynote
Test app I made in Electron for drawing notes, I could have made it in something lighter but I wanted to test out Electron and needed a TODO/Sketch list

This boy can save things once drawn and erase the container, can also be enlarged with the UI adapting to the window's size.
If you think it's crap it's because it is.
